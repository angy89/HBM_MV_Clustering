Multi view clustering for patient sub-typing based on hierarchical block matrix

In this work, we propose a multi-view clustering methodology that, although quite general, could be used to identify patient subgroups, for different omic information, by studying the hierarchical structures of the patient data in each view and merging their topologies. We first demonstrate the ability of our method to identify hierarchical structures in synthetic data sets and then apply it to real multi-view multi-omic data sets. Our results, although preliminary, suggest that this methodology outperforms single-view clustering approaches and could open several directions for improvements.
